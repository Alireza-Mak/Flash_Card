# About the Project: Flash Card
In creating this Python Tkinter flashcard application, my goal was to offer users an intuitive platform for mastering French-English translations. The app seamlessly integrates data handling, dynamically reading from CSV files and persisting missed words. User interaction is facilitated through visually appealing card displays, providing a smooth experience. By emphasizing personalization, the app enhances language learning, allowing users to revisit and reinforce words they find challenging. This project aligns with the vision of creating accessible, engaging tools for effective language acquisition.
